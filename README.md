## About Me

Hello! My name is Raveena Mani and I'm in my fourth year at UC Davis as a computer science major. This site is intended to give you an idea of some of the projects I have worked on and am currently working on.

### [Predicting Drug Consumption using ML Models](https://github.com/lucasrod25/drug-consumption-analysis)
I recently led a team of 12 students for the ECS 171 (Machine Learning) term project. We built models to predict drug consumption from other attributes.

### [Spotify CLI](https://github.com/raveenam0/spotify-cli)
To learn more about APIs and Computer Networks, I created a Spotify command-line interface using the Spotify API and Libcurl to make HTTP requests.

### [Hair Product Checker](https://github.com/raveenam0/hair-product-checker)
This is one of my earliest projects. I worked on this to solidify my understanding of input and output files and C++ vectors.
